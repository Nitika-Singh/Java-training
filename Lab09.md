* Create a package __com.jpmc.lab09__
* Create a __Counter__ class that will have a value initialized to 0.
* The value can be __incremented__ or __decremented__
* The value can be from circles between __0 to 3__.
* If the value is 0 and you decrement, the value becomes 3
* If the value is 3 and you increment, the value becomes 0
* Counter maintains a total number of objects created.

* Here's how the output will look like

```

> d

> d

> n

> c

> i
